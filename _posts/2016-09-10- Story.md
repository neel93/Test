As the night was serene so was my heart and soul. Clouds playing with moon along with cool breeze had an aesthetic effect on me. Soon I opened the cupboard, a diary fell. 2010 it stated.




Soon the whole year played like a reel and then I thought that now it’s time to turn back and enjoy few moments. As soon as I opened, I found a few scribbled notes. No they were not related to the course. It had those turmoil’s of a 20yr old guy who thrived to make a name in the world. I smiled. I turned towards my right and saw mirror. ”Lost”, words escaped form my mouth.
