<b>Prolouge</b>-
<i>Raghav a cool looking guy, a party animal and a die-hard alcohol lover. Carefree attitude made his life worth living for.
But deep inside he was a walking corpse searching for a soul in the outside dead world.
Deeyali a simple girl, nature lover, with big eyes, those spoke more than her soul spoke, those eyes who an alcohol would envy of. With dreams to achieve a life built on her demands and to gain a respect in her family. She has a different side though. Being simple she is a party freak, outspoken. 
Will these mirror images fall or will this love will emerge a fatal yet a passionate.</i>




<b>Part 1</b>




It was a silent night. The clouds were roaring and were crying slowly taking their own time for the outburst. The sea was serene and calm yet moving so as his life and thoughts. Raghav was sitting near the lake with a whisky bottle in his hands and wearing a calm face, but his mind was somewhere else. The weather was playing its card on Raghav. He loved to get drenched in rain, soothing his dead soul.
"Ish! Its raining. I hate when it rains so much mudpools and chip-chip,eeee." Deeyali stepped out from the train to the Pune station, a place where dreams came true. She took an auto to the Paud road where she was going to stay. Suddenly the auto halted with a jerk.
"Kya hua bhaiya"
"Kuch ni gudiya, ek ladka tez bike chala raha tha to samne aa gaya"
Deeyali came out of the auto to look at the biker but he drove fast and vanished in the clouds.




<b>Part 2</b>




Deeyali went to her flat and got soaked in the environment. It was night and the weather turned a bit cold and romatic after the shower.
"Mitti ki khushboo, ummm!.." said she taking a deep breath and savouring the moment. She started to humm her favourite track which she kept on repeat on her cellphone.
" Han hasi ban gaye han nami ban gaye..Tum mere aasman meri zameen ban gaye" she sang and closed her eyes. She saw a same person whom she encountered few time back. She could only see his eyes as he was wearing helmet. Those eyes spoke a lot.
"Kon tha wo?" She thought and went to sleep.
Back in the next apartment Raghav entered his room and he went for a shower to freshen up. Wrapped in a towel along waist he looked in the mirror and smiled, rather tried to smile. Those eyes could hide a million of emotions that his innocent heart couldn’t. After changing he went in the balcony to savour that scene. He loved rain. It connected him to someone unknown whom he still was unaware of. Shuddering off the thoughts of being with someone, he laughed and went to sleep.
....




Deeyali wokeup and rushed to her college, Fergusson College where she pursued Botany with psychology as she tried to study people. She took an auto and being at the gate she rushed. As she rushed she got bumped with a guy and all her documents flew in the air.
"Arey yar mere hi sath ye sab kyun hota hai" said Deeyali and she blabbered continuosly in haste.
The guy bent down and saw Deeyali already collecting her documents. He bent down and helped her. As soon as he gave her she looked up and suddenly her mouth stopped working. She saw the guy. He was just a God appeared from above. He was clad in a red t-shirt and blue denims, he had a perfect body for which any would get complexion. As he took off his glared she was shocked. Those tiny eyes, deep and dark which she saw last night.
Seeing Deeyali's face, Raghav smiled. She wore a blue kurti ending below her knees and pink leggings. Hairs open and wearing big spectacles with bulged out eyes from shock, he couldn’t control himself from smiling at her cuteness.
"Look I’m sorry, maine apko dekha nai tha, I was engrossed in my phone." Said Raghav.
...............




"Hello" he waved his hand in front of her to bring her back. Deeyali coming to her senses and judging that she got late to her class. She ran to her class. Seeing this Raghav smiled and went to his commerce class.
"Cute yet strange" thought Raghav.
"Seriously, those eyes." Thought Deeyali and took her classes.




<b>Part 3</b>




It was evening when Deeyali got over with her classes. The clouds welcomed her with a roar. Tired by the work. She dragged herself outside the college to get an auto. As soon as she took a step the clouds started to shower. She ran towards the shelter and just saw the musical orchestra by nature. She was a diehard music lover and loved to write. She was engrossed in the scene when she was interrupted by the voice.
"Hie miss chashmish" said Raghav.
"Ohh hie...and thanks for the morning incident and sorry too I didn’t react well as I was in a rush" she spoke in one breathe.
"Arey ruk ruk, take a breath. “He said and they both laughed.
"Baarish pasand ni?"Asked Raghav after a long break.
"Pasand hai but agar mood hua to" said Deeyali. She saw kids playing and dancing in the rain in the park. Suddenly Raghav held her hand and took her to the rain.
"Pagal ho kya, bheeg jaungi mai."Said Deeyali while Raghav took her to the rain.
Raghav left Deeyali's hand and kept them on his waist and tilted his face a bit sidewise just like those kids in the rain. Seeing those eyes again, she sighed and went for the shelter again. Raghav couldn’t understand. He looked up, spread his hands and closed his eyes to let the rain to drench his heart. As he opened his eyes, he saw deeyali dancing in the rain with the kids, he smiled.
"Agar SRK ka pose mar chuke ho to do you mind to have a dance? “Said Deeyali.
"I dont know how to dance."
"Baarat me nachne ke liye proffesional hona zaruri ni Mr.?" She stopped in the middle to inquire his name.
"Raghav"
"Deeyali"





This time Deeyali held his hand and took him towards the kids. They danced. Raghav smiled inside out this time. Both the post graduate students played with the school kids like there was no difference between them. After getting a booster dose,Deeyali took a leave as she started feeling cold.
"Coffee?"she turned to Raghav's voice. He was holding two glasses of coffee where Deeyali took the shelter. She took a cup and sat on the wooden bench to have a sip.
"So what you are studying? “Asked Raghav.
"I am doing my post-graduation in Botany and diploma in psychology. What about you?"
"I am pursuing my M.Com and preparing for the GRE" said Raghav.
"Oohh, Foreign and all" smiled Deeyali. They chated for a while and soon after that drink she took his leave and got up to go home.
"See you then" she waved her hand.
As she sat in the auto, her ID card fell down.
"Deeya..." Raghav shouted but it was too late. He took the card and looked for the contact. He rode his bike and went to his flat.
The clouds made their way to welcome the moon and the stars. He was in his balcony with a beer can and his cell phone rung. It was his mom. He talked a while with his family and as he was about to keep his phone in the pocket; he felt something in his pocket. It was that ID card. He flipped it and searched for the contact number.
"Hello?" Deeyali spoke from the other side as Raghav dialled her number.
"Hie deeyali Raghav here. Actually you dropped your ID. It’s with me."
"Ishh! Thanks yar. When i should take it."
"I am always free" said he grinning from ear to ear with a wink. They both laughed at Raghav's dialouge.
"I am going out with few friends. If you dont mind you can join me there, as I'll get bore"
"Sure. See you in a hour."said Raghav and disconnected the call. He dressed while thinking about what a simple girl like Deeyali could do in Miami, the disc.
His bike coughed a bit and he headed towards, Miami.




<b>Part 4</b>




Raghav entered Miami. He was welcomed by the smoke and alcohol. He sat on the couch anf ordered for vodka. He texted Deeyali his location. Few minutes later ge received a shock, which forced him to keep his vodka and ciggrette aside.
Deeyali wore a blue tank top and brown denim shorts. Her hairs all open. Her long slender legs were tied with an anklet. Her hands had tons of bracelets and of course she ignited her nerdy look to the maximum. She came and sat in front of him.
He couldn’t take off his eyes.
"You look......beautiful"
"Thank you."
"Here's your ID"
She took her ID and drank the vodka from Raghav's glass. It was a shock for him. She got up and went on the floor to dance. After exhausting her fuel. She came to Raghav who switched to whisky and gulped down a bottle. Deeyali was alone this time, she brought one of her friends. She wore a black jump suit, hairs open. She looked like a copy of Deeyali just her skin tone was lighter than Deeyali. Raghav was floored at once.
"Rhea" said she introducing herself. Raghav came to know that she was her classmate and was living near his apartment. After a few drinks they headed towards their home. Raghav dropped Deeyali and Rhea and went towards his flat. That night he slept peacefully with Rhea's smiling face in his head.




<b>Part 5</b>




Deeyali was on the way to her college when her phone beeped. It was Raghav. He asked her to meet her in the same café where they sat in that rain. They became good friends. Time passed quickly after the Miami incident.
"Deeyali can you read minds?" said Raghav sipping the coffee with a cigarette in his hand.
"Hehehe. Mai antaryami nahi hu jo logon ke dimag me kya chal rha bata dungi Raghav baccha" she said laughing and making the posture of Saints with her hands.
"Hmm" Raghav's face drooped. Deeyali sensed it.



"Kya puchna hai" she said."Rhea ke bare me" she added after a pause. Raghav looked Deeyali in amaze. Deeyali smiled and punched Raghav to bring him back. He couldnt speak further as Deeyali got everything.
"She is a simple girl. I too don’t know much about her but she is good by nature. She is a bit emotional but knows how to handle in different situations.
I am sorry I couldn’t help you much, though whatever i knew i told you" said Deeyali.



Raghav smiled and hugged Deeyali.



"Scene kya hai boss" said Deeyali.
"I think I like her yaar. I am not sure and it's too early to say too. But I am attracted to her." Said Raghav.
"Dont worry yar. Ab to tumhari jodi bana ke hi rahenge" said Deeyali.
They planned that they would meet out for a movie, when Deeyali would refuse the offer to come so that they could spend some time together. The next day was proceeded as per the plan.
The day was well spent and Raghav got to know more about Rhea. He also came to know that Rhea too reciprocated the same. They were happy and Deeyali supported Raghav to succeed in his love story.
In the duration of helping Raghav, Deeyali fell for Raghav. She tried hard to stop her feelings but she couldnt. She always smiled when she saw both of them together but thousands of thorns stabbed her when she dissected her flowers in the practical. But something stopped her from confessing her love was it Rhea?




<b>Part 6</b>




Rhea and Raghav came close. Deeyali distanced herself from Raghav to be free of this feeling she felt for him. It was not that Raghav didnt care. He noticed every action and reaction of Deeyali.
"Tujhe kya hua hai, aajkal bahut khoyi khoyi rehti hai" asked Raghav concerned about her.
"Kuch nahi" she smiled as she said.



"Mai Rhea ko propose karne wala hu kal." As Raghav said this, Deeyali felt a jerk in 7er heart. What was this for, she should be happy for him as it was her plan to help him to be with Rhea. She smiled weakly and got up to leave. She paid the vendor and rode off to her flat.
Back in his house he was nervous as well as excited for his proposal. It was not the first time he was proposing someone, it was just he felt a strong connection with someone for the first or he thought to be as.
The next day was an off and Deeyali was in her flat in her pyajamas and tee. She was drinking her coffee when she heard the doorbell ring. She got up to see Raghav at her door dressed in a white shirt blue denims. He bent on his knees and took out a red rose and said
"Ye style thik hai ke kuch unique karu" and winked. Deeyali rolled her eyes and her world too.
"Kuch naya try kar. Esa k ladki tere pas bhag ke aaye tujhe hug karke bole, I Love You" said Deeyali and looked at Raghav. Her eyes locked for a moment but soon she broke them off as she didnt want Raghav to read her eyes.
"Mujhe kuch sahi ni lag raha. Tu thodi der ruk ja na" said Deeyali. She felt uneasy that something was going to happen, what it was she didn’t knew. She herself was confused about what was happening with her. Raghav sat with her and then got up to leave. She waved Raghav off and sat with the newspaper again. As she was about to ring her phone ringed. 'Raghav calling'
"Hasa kar na yar haste hue achi dikhti hai" said Raghav.
"And tu bike chalate waqt phone pe bat karta hua acha ni lagta"
"Deeya you know na that I...." the call stopped midway. The sound of crash was heard.
Raghav met with an accident.




<b>Part 7</b>




Deeyali ran in the direction where Raghav went. She searched every corner of the road. She was in tears. When failed she tried to contact Raghav's number. Hopefully it was answered by random kid and she asked his whereabouts. She ran to the same and found Raghav lying unconscious on the road. His eyes were open a little where he could see Deeyali running towards his direction incessantly crying. She took Raghav's head in her lap. She stroked his head and asked that little boy to bring some water. She had already contacted the ambulance. She wiped his face which was blooded. 
Raghav just saw Deeyali. Her words echoed ' let the girl come running to you when you propose to her'
"Deeya......" he spoke a bit to catch his breathe. She cried the hell and wanted Raghav to shut his mouth.
"I........lo..ve....you".
Deeyali's breathe stopped so did her crying. She found the peace after hearing but soon faded.
Rhea dropped into the scene from nowhere. Raghav proposed Rhea there and then. Deeyali's world came down crashing. Soon the ambulance came and Raghav was rushed to the hospital with Rhea.
She soon came back to the senses and ran to the hospital. Once in the hospital, they waited for Raghav to become conscious. Deeyali was still a shocked and was not recovered from what happened all of a sudden. 
"You can meet the patient" said the nurse. She was delighted but soon she stopped in mid. She looked in Rhea's direction and asked her to meet him. A tear trickled down when she turned but soon wiped when she saw the doctors coming. They asked her to complete the formalities as she and Rhea both brought him to the hospital.
"Ma'am kya aap patient ki wife hai?"Asked the nurse. Deeyali couldn’t answer as she was too shocked after Raghav's accident. She signed the form and when she was about to turn. She saw something which turned Deeyali into a zombie like figure.




<b>Part8</b>




Deeyali saw her reflection in the mirror. Her forehead got stained with Raghav's blood when he tried to hold Deeyali, thats why the staff thought Deeyali to be Raghav's wife. Her patience lost her way through her eyes. She walked towards the main door and out. She stopped in her mid-way in the parking. Clouds roared this time in Deeyali's favour. Her knees went weak as did her heart. She dropped down. It’s rained heavily so did Deeyali. She screamed and cried. That blood mixed with rain flowed down through her face.
"Mai ni karti Raghav se pyar, i dont love you. Tum mere kabhi ni ho sakte" she cried. She cuddled their hiding her face between her knees.
"Kyu hua mujhe pyar, kyu. Mai or dard ni seh sakti" she said as she cried. The rain camoflaged her tears and the sorrow. She felt like she would die of the pain she felt.
......




Raghav came into senses after few hours. He smiled Rhea seeing besides him holding his hand. Raghav proposed Rhea and Rhea too. They hugged each other. Deeyali saw them both happy in each other’s arm. She could see Raghav smiling in content. She wiped her tears and promised herself to be happy for them or atleast for Raghav
Raghav got scared for Deeyali seeing her in that state. She was in a screwed condition.
"Kya hua tujhe?" Said Raghav sitting on the bed with the help of Rhea.
"Kutte tu kya kam karta hai. Kaise hua accident dauda diya hum dono ko" said Deeyali hiding her tears.
Raghav told them that his bike slipped when suddenly a kid ran in the mid of road. As it rained so his bike disbalanced and slipped. Rhea started crying hearing this and hid herself in his arms. Deeyali's emotions drained with the rain and with Raghav's blood she became his. She got honoured with Raghav's blood on her forehead. May be it was God's plan.
"Hello? Kahan khoyi hai" Raghav snapped his fingers.
"Congratulations tum dono finally sath ho" said Deeyali flashing her smile.
"But maine to tujhe bataya hi ni, fir kaise?"
"Tu road pe tha jab mai aayi thi. Tune Rhea ko dekh ke bol dala I love you. Khud ko hero samjhta hai mar raha hai fir bhi bolna hai janab ko i love you" said Deeyali punching Raghav. She left both of them to spend some time alone. She left for her flat, leaving her heart for Raghav.





<b>Part9</b>




Deeyali accepted Raghav and Rhea's relationship. She concentrated on her studies but back in her mind she thought of Raghav. She thought time would heal her heartbreak but the pain got deep with time. Being a writer by hobby, she penned down her feelings and found solace. 
Raghav despite of being with Rhea was not that happy. Something was missing in his life. That emptiness that he felt and the dark past of unsuccessful love haunted him. He didn’t shared that with anyone and kept mum. He thought it was his thinking only and time would heal things.
Months passed and Diwali came. Raghav threw a party at his house for few of his close friends. Deeyali and Rhea came too. 
"Someone is looking damn handsome" said Rhea leaning to the door of Raghav's room.
He wore a black sherwani. 
"Someone too is looking like an angel sent from heaven in my arms" said he and hugged her. Rhea wore a blue and white shaded saree. Raghav asked about Deeyali after hugging Rhea. He walked past the hall and went in the balcony. He saw Deeyali on the floor lighting the candles and Deeya. Soft breeze teased her hairs and hindered her vision. Raghav was too mesmerised to see this version of hers. She wore a red and black saree, her hairs open little above the waist. She wore light makeup and the bindi added a charisma to her beauty. 
"You surprise me everytime" said Raghav sitting next to her with a candle.
Deeyali saw Raghav and smiled. The composed herself back to normal and said
"Koi ni sari ladkiyon se suicide karwa raha hai."and they both laughed. Few minutes later Raghav's friends joined them all and Raghav introduced them all to Rhea.
"She is my girlfriend and the love of my life."
All his friends were shocked as they never saw the loving and caring side of Raghav. Then they celebrated the Diwali by lighting crackers and most important in which they were best.'drinking'. That night opened the lots of secrets and closed lots of chapters




<b>Part 10</b>




Rhea and Raghav got pitch drunk. Rhea started blabbering and started shouting and screaming her love. Raghav's friends too after the drinking session went to their home. Raghav took Rhea to his room and spent the most romantic and steamy night where their love bloomed, unaware of Deeyali. After that he left Rhea to her home safely and kissed her back and drove to his house.
Deeyali sat in his balcony. With the pitch dark night and sounds of the crackers, she took the whisky bottle and looked at the Deeya's she lit. She was composed but her heart was a cyclone. Raghav came home. He went to his room to change out of his room in the trousers to drink water. He knew Deeyali was staying at his house as her flat was at distance. He went for a drag outside innthe balcony when he saw Deeyali in whole devastated state. He knew Deeyali drink but he didnt knew that she would drink whisky as it was too hard for that innocent soul. She lied on the floor infront of the deeya's looking towards the sky. Raghav laid down beside her to make her aware of his presence. He stroked her hairs in concern. She closed her eyes to again compose herself. A tear trickled down her eyes. 
"Kya hua Deeya?"Asked concerned Raghav.



"Tumhe pata hai Diwali me hum diye kyu jalate hai?" spoke Deeyali looking at the Deeya's. 
"Aj ke din bhagwan Ram wapas Ayodhya aaye the to usi khushi me jalate hai. Jo logon ke life me andhera tha usko mitane k liye" spoke Raghav. At this Deeyali laughed sarcastically. He knew that something hurt Deeyali and it was high time that she was speaking to him. He took a sip from her bottle and too got drunk and listened to her.
"Logon ki zindagi me ujala karne ke liye hum Diye jalate hai. Ram ko hum bhagwan bolte hai aur ye sochte hai ke wo mitti ko bhi ek insan ki tarh dekhte hai. Agar wo bhagwan hote to shayad unhe ye bhi dikhai de jaata ke dusron ko roshan karne wala aur khushi dene wala har ek diya khud ko jala kar, mar kar kaise musibaton se ladta hua unki nayi zindagi me shamil hone ke liye." Summarised Deeyali. Raghav was taken aback by this change in Deeyali. He went speechless and wanted to speak her heart out. 
Deeyali got up, staggering on her feet. Raghav supported her. 



"Kya hua Deeyali? Mujhe ni batayegi tu? Apne Raghav ko bhi nahi?" Said and he made her sit again on the floor. 
"Mera Raghav?"And she laughed. "Agar mera Raghav hota to shayad Rhea ki jagh mai hoti."She added. Raghav sensed that Deeyali was not at all okk and maybe the sudden breaking up of limits with Rhea shocked her. He changed the topic to make Deeyali chirpy once again but he failed.
"Jab itni chadh chuki hai to pi kyu tune. Maine mana kiya tha na mat ban meri jaisi." Scolded Raghav. 
"Tu kyu pita hai Raghav?"said Deeyali keeping her head on his shoulder.
"Kyunki mujhe acha lagta hai pina. Mujhe pyar hai pine se" he spoke harshly. "Mera chord tune kyu pi.?" He added and Deeyali got up again to go to the other room marking the end of discussion. As she got up, Raghav held her hand and asked for explanation.
"KYUNKI TUJHE PYAR HAI PINE SE AUR MUJHE TUJHSE PYAR HAI... I love you Raghav" she screamed. 
"Maine tujhse bahut pyar kiya hai. Mujhe nahi pata kab mujhe pyar hua aur pyar ke mayane kya hai, per mai itna janti hu ke agar teri khushi ke liye is deeya ko bujhna pade to mujhe manzur hai Raghav. Mujhe tere liye agar apne apko jalana bhi pade to mai taiyar hu. Teri ek hasi ke liye, apne Raghav ke liye agar is Deeyali ko zindagi bhar uske ujale ke liye jalna pade to manzur hai."said Deeyali crying. 
Raghav stood aghast there, not believing what he just heard. Deeyali's knees went weak and she dropped down like a sack and cried. Raghav who still held her hand, sat close to her and hugged her. 
That night the life of Raghav changed drastically and Deeyali fainted in his arms.




<b>Part 11</b>




Raghav sat their holding Deeyali in his arms for a long time like a statue. He thought about the few moments back when his life crashed down. He looked down at Deeyali's face which was hidden in his chest, numb and motionless. He stood up, took Deeyali up in his arms and walked towards the room. He cozily made Deeyali lie on the bed and sat down sidewise holding her hand and seeing her face. He felt confused and happy at the same time. His soul was smiling within and his heart readily accepted Deeyali. His heart and eyes screamed his love for her but his lips failed to speak. That tender leaf came into his life which was barren. He was scared to love that selfless soul because of the harshness lying within.
"I dont no Deeya what is happening. But if this is called love, then I love you" Said his heart and tears rolled down his eyes.
Deeyali came into senses but due to excess alcohol consumption her eyes failed to open. She cried herself to sleep as she did earlier. With every sniff she took, Raghav shed a tear. Her pain stabbed Raghav and he cursed himself. He got up and kissed her on the forehead. The night passed with both holding hands together.
Deeyali woke up with a hangover. She held her head in her hands and tried to memorise what happened last night. Raghav was in the kitchen making coffee for both of them when Deeyali came. 
"Mai yahn kaise hun? Kal mai ghar nahi gayi thi kya. Kal rat ko kya hua"said Deeyali in a kid-like tone.
"Arey tu late ho gayi thi to yahin ruk gayi thi"
"Tu is saree me ghum le rahi hai kaise? Ja k meri shirt ya t-shirt pehn le thoda freely to rahegi." 
"Mai kaise. Pagal ho kya" said Deeyali sounding normal yet angry.
"Arey ma pehn le. Mai hi to hu na" said Raghav assuring Deeyali. Deeyali went inside and changed. Raghav prepared himself to face Deeyali, normally. She came and the coffee was waiting for her.
They both drank coffee in silence when sudden emotions over powered Raghav. He swayed his hands over Deeyali's head and kissed her. Deeyali couldn’t protest further nor could she respond the kiss. After breaking the kiss, Raghav told everything to Deeyali about the previous night. Deeyali couldn’t speak further but kept looking Raghav's eyes; those eyes whom she fell in love with.
"Deeyali, i love you. But I can’t be with you as you are too sweet for a guy like me. I have already ruined your life alot, I cant any further." Said Raghav with damp eyes. Deeyali got up as she couldn’t speak any further. She already knew what lied in the store for her. She took her belongings with her shattered heart too and went. She looked at Raghav for the last time. She went to abroad for her Ph.D. and also to fix her heart.
Years passed. Deeyali settled herself in Paris, the city of love. She was doing her Ph.d in Pyschology after the masters. Raghav did his MBA and worked internationally with the companies in France. The incident that took 5 years back still haunted both of them. 
"But sir, how you can shift me to Paris all of a sudden without any notice. I have a family here" he lied.
After that incident Raghav couldn’t love Rhea. Soon due to lack of love they broke up. Raghav was already struggling with family. The void his life had could only be fulfilled by Deeyali, but she left without contacting anyone. He tried searching Deeyali but couldn’t find her. But destiny had chosen them both long ago than they themselves. It played its cards either to unite or to destruct.




<b>Part 12</b>




Raghav was left with no choice. He packed his stuff and boarded the flight. He suffered a lot in his life. First his family tensions made him run to Pune. After that he met Deeyali, fun loving and with a caring heart, who destroyed herself for him. On the other hand Rhea, who supported him at times but couldn’t give him the peace he wanted. All these years he thought about Deeyali. He tried to find her but failed.
After hours of tedious journey. Raghav reached to the hotel room and threw himself on the bed and soon fell asleep. He woke up and went to explore Paris. He stopped near a bar. The adrenaline rush made him go inside. He occupied the seat and started drinking. Soon the sound of the music increased and people howled on the dance floor. He saw a girl dancing on middle of the floor. He went in the direction to see. As he saw he froze on his place. It was Deeyali. She was wearing a black dress and was dancing. He couldn’t speak nor react to what he saw.
Deeyali saw Raghav. She too froze on her place. The memories came in front of her face like a gush of wind. She remembered the day she last saw Raghav and that kiss. The crowd started hooting which was enough to bring Raghav to his senses. It was the time to act. He took his steps towards Deeyali, held her hand and aimed towards the door. Once on the street, he left her hand. Deeyali was in tears to see the only love she had. Raghav hugged her out of life. 
"Kahan chali gayi thi tu? Ek call bhi nai" said Raghav. Deeyali stood silent in his arms. It was enough for him to understand the reason. They parted a little and started to walk down the street. After discussing about the whereabouts of each other, Deeyali enquired about Rhea.
"We broke up. We were not compatible. We both tried to save this relation but failed" he gave the explanation.
Deeyali just saw Raghav in awe. She didnt knew how to react and was not satisfied with his explanation. Raghav inched a bit closer to Deeyali and gave a peck on her lips. She froze again. She threw her arms around his neck and they passionately kissed each other. The rains too came down to witness their love. They broke their kiss. Deeyali's eyes were still closed. He came closer and said those words which Deeyali wanted to hear.
"I love you. Tujhse kab pyar hua mujhe nai pata. Maine tujhe bahut rulaya hai per ab aur nahi. Tu meri thi or meri hi rahegi. I love you Deeya." He said and hugged her.
That night proved to be the start of new chapter in the city of Romance, Paris.




<b>Part 13</b>




That night Raghav and Deeyali united. They made love to each other and completed their souls. Raghav who dwindled in his past finally found peace. Meanwhile for Deeyali, she lived in a fairy tale. 
Months passed. Raghav finally smiled from his heart and did tremendous job in his office. Deeyali too joined as a counsellor and a part time magazine editor and helped the people. 
Deeyali waited for Raghav as usual at their favourite spot, every lover’s dream, Eiffel tower. She had a gift for Raghav as it was his birthday. She waited for him but he didn’t come. She got scared and contacted him but the calls went unanswered. She got scared and started crying. 
After hours, Raghav came. He was sad. He was transferred from Paris to India (Pune). He didn’t had the courage to say that to Deeyali. He came and sat beside Deeyali who was crying with her face in her palms. He stroked her hairs to make her aware of his presence. She hugged him and complained about his behaviour.
"Where were you? Jaan nikal di thi meri. Kuch ho jata to." she said crying in his arms.
Raghav didnt respond. Deeyali sensed something was wrong. She looked at Raghav and asked for explanation. Raghav's eyes went damp.
"Deeya, we can’t stay together. I have been transferred back to Pune." he said and paused. Deeyali stood up so did Raghav. He held her hands and added further.
"You have settled in your life here only. I don’t want to ruin your career baby. Let me settle once, I promise I will take you to our home."
Deeyali's eyes couldnt hide her tears. She silently cried which blurred her vision.
"Will you wait for me?" asked Raghav lowering his face to look at Deeyali. She couldn’t speak anything to him. 
"I have to leave in few hours baby."that was another shock for her to handle. He kissed her for last time and they parted.
But surprises waited for Raghav too. Deeyali took out an envelope and gave it to Raghav and said him to read it there and then. She kissed him back and turned to leave as she couldnt see him going. The cold air blew so did their hearts frizzed with each other’s love.
Raghav opened the envelope. He couldn’t believe what he read in that piece of paper. Deeyali was tested positive for pregnancy. She bore their love. He started crying in happiness.
"DEEYA" screamed Raghav. She turned. She was still in the shock that Raghav left her. Raghav sat on his knees with the envelope in his hand.
"Will you be my Mrs. Deeyali Verma." He screamed. 
Deeya ran to him as she earlier did. She sat in front of Raghav on her knees and cried. Raghav took out his coat to cover Deeyali from cold. He kissed her on forehead and together they flew for Pune, unaware what lied in future




<b>Part 14</b>




Back in Pune, they got married. He took care of her and their baby, handled her every mood swing. Soon months passed and she gave birth to baby boy and they named him 'Ansh', symbol of their love. As she came to Pune in a haste, she had left incomplete work back in Paris. 
"Tu abhi kyu ja rahi. What about Ansh?"Asked Raghav when she told about her decision to go to Paris for few days.
"Mai jaldi aa jaungi Raghav. They are eating my mind from past few months."explained Deeyali. She packed her bag and hugged Raghav. She took Ansh in her arms and kissed him on his forehead. Tear trickled down her eyes. Seeing this Raghav took both in his arms and clicked a photograph. They both left for their office and to Mumbai respectively.
After reaching to the office, Raghav opened the image he clicked few hours before and smiled. A smile of content and being happy crossed his face. As soon as he was about to call Deeyali, he received a call from his mother.
"Beta come home fast “she said crying severely on the phone. He could hear little 6 months old Ansh screaming and crying in background. His heart sank and skipped several beats.
"Kya hua ma."he asked softly praying everything would be fine.
"Beta Deeya...."she said and again started crying.
"Kya hua Deeya ko. Bolo na ma. “Said Raghav rushing towards his car.
"Beta her plane crashed. Beta Deeya she left us." Said Raghav's mom.
Raghav's phone fell from his hand. He went all numb. He couldn’t scream, he couldn’t cry. Deeya's smiling face came in front of his eyes. The moment he first saw her, they danced, the diwali night when Deeya destroyed herself in his arms and the day Ansh came into their life. He went on his knees. It rained heavily. 
Raghav dragged himself on the roads drowning heavily in the rain. He couldn’t feel anything. His life was destroyed in moments in which he thought he was blessed by God.
He reached his home. Seeing his mother, he collapsed. He saw the name plate which said
"Raghav and Deeyali Verma" 
The home was abandoned now.




<b>Part 15</b>




His mother took him in her shielding arms. He screamed. He broke down. That soul that was brought to life by Deeyali, died. He became a living corpse. He couldnt even see her body for once. He sat there on the door for hours in hope that Deeyali would come to save him but it all went in vain.
His mother brought Ansh,who slept peacefully. He gave him in his lap. Raghav cried silently.
"No beta you can’t. She has blessed you with Ansh, tumdono ka Ansh. You have to take care of him. You have to fulfil her dreams."
Raghav nodded. He got up and went to his room, the room which ate him. He kept Ansh in cradle. He sat on the window, witnessing the lights outside and darkness inside him. His cell phone buzzed. It was the last text from Deeyali which she sent before sitting in the plane.
"Raghav, I love you. This distance is just for the short period of time. Mai chahe jitni bhi dur rahu, tumse aur Ansh ke pas hamesha rahungi. Dont worry i will return safely.XOXO." Raghav cried this time.
"Kyu chali gayi Deeya." He shouted and cried. He cuddled himself like a little kid on the floor. Deeyali's diary lied there on the floor. It read the lines which Deeya wrote years back.
"Khud jal kar bhi ye Deeyali karti rahegi ujala apne Raghav ki zindagi me.
Apni lau ke har ek Ansh se khushiyan banaye rakhegi apne Raghav ki zindagi me"
Raghav took the diary and remembered the night when Deeyali fainted in his arms that Diwali night.





Years passed to Deeyali's death, but that didn’t bother Raghav. He still lived thinking about her and cried to sleep. Ansh grew and soon came the time when he was about to go to his school, his first day.
Raghav was in front of the mirror getting ready when his gaze fell on the frame having Deeyali's photo. He looked again himself in the mirror and said,
"Mera to koi vajud hai hi nahi tere bina" he went to his past memories back in Paris when they lived together and got ready together in a single mirror.
"Papa" stood little Ansh in a red and blue uniform with a bottle hanging down his neck. Raghav took him in his arms and took him to the place where he kept Deeyali's belongings;her huge photograph hanging on the wall, her diary, her mangalsutra and most important, a Deeya which he always kept lit.
"Beta say bye to your mumma. She always loved you and will be seeing from above to see her Ansh studying and becoming just like her and papa. “Said Raghav and Ansh kissed him.
Ansh came down Raghav's arms and rushed to his grandmother. Raghav stood there smiling at her face. Soon he felt a hand on his shoulder. He turned to find out Deeya standing in a black saree. He always imagined her to be near him, close to his heart. He turned back to the photograph and gently stroked his hand over her photograph as he used to stroke her hair locks.
"I love you chashmish" his eyes went damp but soon a smile occupied as Ansh pulled him to his car.
Together they drove to Ansh's school. And Raghav saw his and hers Ansh fulfilling Deeyali's dream; <i>with Deeyali's soul in her most peaceful place, his arms.</i>
